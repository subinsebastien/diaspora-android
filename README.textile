h1. The Diaspora for Android-Client

This is the Android-Client for the privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social network.

h2. Current state of development

All the stuff you can find here is *not usable yet*. We are at an early stage of development - we're still planning and discussing about what we are going to do.

h2. Contributing

At the moment, all our communication is done via the "diaspora-android mailinglist":groups.google.com/group/diaspora-android If you want to contribute, take a look in there and see if there are any open things.

If you have any questions you can write to that mailinglist or ask "denschub":http://github.com/denschub via IRC. Usually you can find him in "#diaspora-dev":http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=diaspora-dev at freenode.

Please give us some time until there is a ToDo-list with things you can start working on. :)
